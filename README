bower install directory

To customize the location of the bower packages installed create a .bowerrc file and give the path to the installation directory for the directory key


Cleaning and compiling CoffeeScript files in testapp
-----------------------------------------------------

To clean src folder and compile CoffeeScript files into javascript files, there is a shell script called mm that I have put in ~/bin that will do this for you as follows:


To clean your coffeescript files do:

mm -f

from your application root directory

e.g.

cd testapp
mm -f

To compile your coffeescript files do:

mm -c


Starting the MacOs Apache server and accessing your application
---------------------------------------------------------------

sudo apachectl start/restart

If it doesn't start, do sudo apachectl -t to check if you have any errors in the configuration files. If you do, correct the error and restart apache again.

Once the server is started access your application by navigating to:

http://localhost/testapp

Your web files should be under:

~/Sites/testapp
